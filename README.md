# Weather-App-Project

This repository is a collection of 3 different iterations of my weather app project. My first iteration consisted of hosting the application on AWS using Docker and Lambda, the second iteration utilized ECS + Fargate and the third iteration I created a custom machine image with Packer and hosted the application on EC2.

For all 3 iterations I used Terraform to deploy the infrastructure and Azure DevOps as my CI/CD pipeline. 

For system monitoring, I used a mix of Cloudwatch and DataDog.

Each folder has it's own READ.ME with more information
